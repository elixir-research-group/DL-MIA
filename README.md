# DL-MIA
DL-MIA  is the first of it's kind intent-docuemnt ranking datasets which consists of high quality user intents annotated over a small yet challenging set of
26 queries from the TREC-DL ’21 and ’22 datasets. Towards this we used a combination of LLM-generated query-specific intents and sub-intents that is post-processed through a carefully designed  crowd sourcing process to ensure human oversight and quality control. ML-DIA mainly aims to measuring the gap between user intent with query intent by fine-grained intent annotation.
